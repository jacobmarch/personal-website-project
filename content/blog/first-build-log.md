This site is now powered by **Next.js App Router** with a local markdown blog workflow.

## Why this setup

- Fast iteration without a CMS lock-in
- Posts live in version control
- Easy future expansion into projects, essays, and experiments

## Posting workflow

1. Add a new `.md` file in `content/blog`.
2. Include frontmatter fields: `title`, `date`, `excerpt`, and optional `tags`.
3. Visit `/blog` and your post should appear automatically.

Future updates will include richer components and media embeds.
