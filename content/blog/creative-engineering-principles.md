I treat creative engineering as a balance of **clarity**, **energy**, and **execution**.

## 1. Intent before interface

Every page should communicate its purpose in the first few seconds.

## 2. Constraints create style

Limited colors, a tight type system, and restrained motion produce stronger identity than endless options.

## 3. Ship in layers

Start with a strong baseline, then add depth: richer content, media, and interactive experiments.

This is the foundation I am using for this personal site.
