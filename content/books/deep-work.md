`Deep Work` is a sharp reminder that attention is a finite resource and most modern workflows are designed to fracture it.

## What stood out

- Newport treats concentration as a trainable skill, not a personality trait.
- The scheduling examples make "focus" operational instead of vague.
- The section on shallow work helped me audit recurring tasks with more honesty.

## Where I disagreed

Some prescriptions assume stronger control over your calendar than many teams allow. The core principles still hold, but implementation depends on your role and environment.

## What I am applying

I now batch reactive communication windows and protect one high-focus block each day before noon. That single shift already improved throughput on complex engineering tasks.
